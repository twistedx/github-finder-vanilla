# github-finder-vanilla
This app was developed with vanilla React.  It will search GitHub users and pull in all matches for the name.  Upon clicking a name it will bring in the specific users information.

This was made while following the @bradtraversy Udemy tutorial. Thanks Brad for a great lesson!
